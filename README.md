# USGSLeaflet

The following repository includes a leaflet map of geoJSON data for all earthquakes from the past 7 days on the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page. Data markers reflect he magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color. Markers include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when selected.
